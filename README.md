NumToWordsConverter
===================
Program Discription:
This program takes in any number and converts it to its equivelance in English words.

Currently the program is in it's simplest form.

Supports integers without decimal points and will only convert numbers from 0-100000.

The program currently does not take input from the user and only uses a built in array for testing purposes.

This concept is usually ideal for accounting purposes.
